# Star Type Classification using MLP and KNN

This repository contains the Python code used for the comparative analysis of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithms in the classification of stars into two categories: Giants and Dwarfs. The analysis is part of the study presented in the article "Comparative Analysis of MLP and KNN Algorithms for Star Type Classification".

## Project Description

The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of MLP and KNN algorithms on a star dataset. The performance metrics used are precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing the data, training the models, performing cross-validation, and plotting the results.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x installed on your system. The primary libraries used are:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow (or any other DL framework that you use for MLP)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
```
